# Face Mask Detection Project

This project is for face mask detection using machine learning.

## Project Structure

- `FaceMaskInit.py`: Script for initializing face mask detection.
- `TrainModelInit.py`: Script for training the model.
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`: Haar cascade file for face detection.
- `Libraries.txt`: List of required Python libraries.
- `train/` and `test/`: Directories containing training and testing images.
- `maskmodel.h5` and `maskmodel.keras`: Trained model files (excluded from git).

## Setup

1. Install the required libraries listed in `Libraries.txt`:

```
pip install -r Libraries.txt
```

2. Run the training and detection scripts as needed.

## Notes

- The `train/` and `test/` directories contain image datasets and are excluded from the repository to keep the repo size manageable.
- The trained model files are also excluded for the same reason.
